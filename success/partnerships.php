			<h3>The Popup Creche</h3>

			<p>The Popup crèche is a community based project based in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. It has been developed in partnership with Westway Trust, the Clement James, Venture Community Association and Catalyst housing.</p>
			<p>Currently the Popup crèche is providing childcare at Venture on Wednesday mornings, which is allowing local parent/carers to access Yoga classes and African Dance. This is contributing to the parent/carers health and wellbeing and the children are
				able to access a range of activities in the crèche. One of the great advantages of having a crèche at the Venture Centre is the outside area which is a designated space for children to play in. This is fantastic as it allows children to play and learn
				in the outside environment.</p>
			<p>One of the parents who has been accessing the crèche stated that she had not been aware of the Venture Centre until she had accessed the crèche, but would bring all of her children to the centre, so they could play in the outside space.</p>
			<p>The Popup crèche also provides employment and volunteering opportunities for local people. Currently we have a local person who is volunteering in the Venture Centre crèche and is gaining valuable childcare experience and will be accessing a level
				2 childcare course in September.</p>

			<h3>Nova New Opportunities</h3>

			<p>Nova New Opportunities delivers a range of basic maths, English and ICT courses for adults at Venture Centre.</p>
			<p>Venture Centre is in a brilliant location for local people to access services and has a great range of complimentary activities for users to get involved with.</p>
			<p>Nova courses are designed to support learners to progress and take nationally recognised exams when they are ready. Nova learners also get help to move on to employment from our team of advisers. One of our learners was even lucky enough to get a job
				at Venture Centre!</p>

			<h3>Go Golborne</h3>

			<p>Go Golborne is a healthy lifestyle pilot project led by RBKC’s public health team that aims to support organisations working with local children and families to promote healthy lifestyles and make it easier for children to eat well and keep active.</p>
			<p>Naami and the team at the Venture Centre have been key champions of Go Golborne since the early stages and have made many valuable contributions to the design and delivery of the project.</p>
			<p>They are a strong advocate for local families and openly share their rich understanding of the local community to help ensure services and activities are shaped to meet their needs.</p>
			<p>They are really collaborative and well-connected and have used their positive relationships with other agencies to help build support for Go Golborne across the community. I really value their proactive and creative approach and the great sense of
				fun they inject to all that they do.</p>
			<p>Venture Centre is in a brilliant location for local people to access services and has a great range of complimentary activities for users to get involved with.</p>

			<p>Ellie Lewis, Senior Public Health Officer/Go Golborne Co-ordinator</p>
